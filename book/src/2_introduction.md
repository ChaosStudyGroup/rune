# Introduction

Welcome the *The Rune Programming Language*, a reference guide about Rune.

Rune is an embeddable dynamic programming language that runs on a stack machine.

The goal of Rune is to reimagine Rust as a dynamic programming language.
Trying to copy as many concepts as possible, and remixing ones which do not
translate into something which feels familiar.
