# Foreword

> "Why am I making a programming language?"

This question keeps rolling around in my head as I'm typing out the code that is
slowly shaping into *Rune*. Programming is like magic. You imagine it in your
mind, write it out, and there it is. Doing *stuff* which wasn't being done
before.

Truth be told, I'm scared that people will tell me that I'm wasting my time.
This has already been done, or "Why not just use X?". An thing so glaringly
obvious that all of my efforts are wasted.

But you actually don't need a reason. It can simply be for The [Joy of
Creating], and then it's just you spending your own time as a hobby. No harm
done. But I want to talk about why I'm making Rune beyond just for fun. So I'm
dedicating this foreword to it. Because I want others to benefit from this I'm
obligated to describe why it might matter to them.

So here's why I started making a new programming language.

## The other project

I've spent a lot of effort working on [OxidizeBot], a Twitch bot that streamers
can use to add commands and other interactive things in their chat. I built it
for myself while streaming, but I'm also a generaliser. When adding features I
always spend way to much time tinkering with it. Making it as generic as
possible, so it can solve more than just one problem. And when it's a personal
project, I just don't care about being efficient. I care much more deeply about
doing things the right way.

...

Ok, I *sometimes* do that professionally as well. But a working environment is
much more constrained.

Anyway, that means the bot isn't incredibly specialized to my needs and can be
used by others. It's starting to see a little bit of that use now, which is a
lot of fun. I made something which helps people do something cool.

All the commands in the bot are written in [Rust], and [compiled straight into
the bot]. This is nice because Rust is an incredible language. But Rust is also
complex. Not nedlessly mind you. In my view it's complex because it decided to
tackle *really hard problems*. And that usually comes with a [base level of
complexity] that it's very hard to get rid of.

But it's still tricky enough that streamers who have very little programming
experience struggle getting up and running*. I wanted them to be able to write
their own commands. Ones they could just drop into a folder and *presto* -
you're up and running.

> *: To this day I've tutored two of these streamers who were interested in
> learning Rust to write their own commands.

For this reason I started looking into dynamic programming languages. Ones that
could be embedded into an existing Rust application with little to no effort.
That seemlessly integrates with its environment.

Type systems are the best thing since sliced bread. But type systems are also
one of these complexities which can get in the way of being productive if you're
not familiar with them. Not everyone wants to learn how to climb before they can
walk.

So a number of candidates came up, and the one that stood out the most to me was
[Rhai].

So why is Rhai awesome? It has Rust-like syntax. The runtime is fully written in
mostly safe Rust, and can be easily embedded. Hooking up Rust functions is a
piece of cake.

But Rhai has a set of features and design constraints which didn't *exactly*
scratch my itch. And the more I used it, the more I thought about things that
could be changed or added. [I contributed a bit to the project]. But it started
to dawn on me that Rhai's approach wasn't exactly what I wanted. There's nothing
wrong with this. The authors of Rhai have specific ideas of what they wanted to
accomplish which lends itself to one design.

While I believe that it's feasible to push Rhai in a different direction, I also
think the project would emerge looking much different on the other side. So I
wanted a fresh slate to find my own compromises. To discover more freely what
works and doesn't work well.

When I started I had the following rough goals in mind:

* Performance should be comparable to Lua and Python (And eventually LuaJIT when we have cranelift).
* Scripts should compile quickly.
* Rune should feel like Rust without types.
* Be as good as Rhai when it comes to integrating with native Rust.
* Make sure Rune's internals will work well through C bindings.
* A lightweight runtime that is strictly singlethreaded*.

> *: If this feels like a step backwards, don't worry too much. We can still
  have concurrency and threads using async code.

Rune is now in a state where I want people to poke at it. Not *too* hard mind
you, because it's still very early days. So don't use it in anything user-facing
or security critical. A miscompilation will cause the wrong closure to be
called. You know, the one which *doesn't* do all your fancy security checks ðŸ˜….

But the more poking and prodding people do, the more issues will be found. Every
solved issue brings Rune one step close to being production ready.

I really want to thank Jonathan Turner and the Rhai project. They have been a
huge inspirationa to me. If you need an embedded scripting engine that is more
mature right now than *Rune*, please take *Rhai* for a spin.
